# Papapackage

This cli watches all your projects and copies changed files to all node_modules folders of dependencies.

# Installation

`yarn global add papapackage`

# Usage

Run papapackage in the folder you want to watch:

`papapackage`

or

`papapackage ~/Documents`

(or any other folder)

# Let papa do the work

Now you can let papa do the work, and never worry that you have an old version installed!
